      <description>TLDR: Learn how to configure 1Password to use your fingerprint to authenticate within the Twilio CLI and reduce how often you manually type in credentials.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to highlight a 1Password Shell Plugin that makes authentication with the Twilio CLI as easy as scanning your fingerprint.
You can configure 1Password to securely authenticate the Twilio CLI, so you never have to manually type your credentials in the terminal again.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Halloween! Want to scare your friends and family with a fun app?
If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with Scream, a famous movie from 1996, there&amp;rsquo;s a famous scene where a killer calls a victim. Watch it here:
I wanted to re-create this scene using Twilio, so I built it with Twilio Studio, a low-code tool from Twilio.
If you want to try it out, text anything to (940) 394-8137
I also wrote a tutorial, so you can build this app yourself.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been a company sponsor at a tech conference, you&amp;rsquo;d know that attracting attendees is difficult. This project solves that issue, because attendees can interact with a video game while also learning about Twilio products &amp;amp; offerings.
TwilioQuest is Twilio&amp;rsquo;s educational video game. Within the game, you can add your own custom extensions to it. I forked a version of Nathaniel&amp;rsquo;s, another Twilio Developer Evangelist, and added multiple features/improvements to it.</description>
