      <description>Want to organize your email inbox?
How about exposing a different email address for different purposes?
I set up email forwarding so that I can receive emails to my existing Gmail inboxes, but use different email address names.
For example, these are my different email addresses:
 hello@anthonydellavecchia.com - general things dev@anthonydellavecchia.com - software development hireme@anthonydellavecchia.com - job seeking photo@anthonydellavecchia.com - photography design@anthonydellavecchia.com - design  What&amp;rsquo;s the Point? Everything is</description>

      <description>Google Analytics is a web analytics tool that lets you track &amp;amp; report your website&amp;rsquo;s traffic. It shows you information such as how many users have visited your site, what devices they use (mobile or computer), how they found your site (direct url, link from other sites), etc.

      <title>How to Animate an Emoji with CSS</title>

      <description>If you go to the home page of this website, you might find some hidden &amp;ldquo;easter eggs&amp;rdquo; around the page. One of which is an emoji that is animated using CSS. 👋 is the emoji. It&amp;rsquo;s just a waving hand, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually wave. There is no animation, so I wanted to make it move. It&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty easy!
Step 1: Create HTML &amp;lt;div class=&amp;#34;waving&amp;#34; data-hover=&amp;#34;👋&amp;#34;&amp;gt; Hi &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; All I&amp;rsquo;ve done here is create a simple div with the text, &amp;ldquo;Hi&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Having an online personal brand is ever so important. Part of this includes having a unified profile picture and logo. You can take this to another level by animating the logo!
Although I have experience with design tools like Photoshop, Lightroom, and Premiere I have never worked with animation. I found a website called SVGator which animates SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). The free version has many limitations but I was able to use it to create my animated logo.</description>
