      <description>I customized and tweaked multiple existing themes for my resume, which can be viewed in conjunction with my JSON Resume. I didn&amp;rsquo;t build these from scratch, only customized them to my liking. Currently I have customized 14 themes, all of which can be viewed from the homepage of this site.
Users can easily view my Resume by selecting a different one from a dropdown menu.
Each theme is unique and has a different style for different audiences.</description>

      <title>Designing an Animated Logo</title>

      <description>Having an online personal brand is ever so important. Part of this includes having a unified profile picture and logo. You can take this to another level by animating the logo!
Although I have experience with design tools like Photoshop, Lightroom, and Premiere I have never worked with animation. I found a website called SVGator which animates SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). The free version has many limitations but I was able to use it to create my animated logo.</description>

      <description>Initially, the goal of this site was to quickly create and deploy a personal website. However, over time, I became more and more invested in it. I&amp;rsquo;ve spend HOURS customizing and adding in new features. Check out this Kanban board which shows how many enhancements I&amp;rsquo;ve made.
Since my main goal was to quickly create a website, I used Hugo, a popular open-source static site generator. Hugo is built with Go lang.</description>
