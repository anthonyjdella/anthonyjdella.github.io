      <description>Daily Stand-Up is a meeting that many developers have to do on a daily basis. And it SUCKS!
The reasons why we (developers) hate it:
It&amp;rsquo;s just another meeting You have to stand up You have to listen to that one rambling co-worker (aka Chad) I built this app that solves these problems
It was built with:
Studio, a low-code tool from Twilio Airtable, a database/spreadsheet REST APIs that I built in Python and Flask If you want to try it out, text anything to (844) 668-2535</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Halloween! Want to scare your friends and family with a fun app?
If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with Scream, a famous movie from 1996, there&amp;rsquo;s a famous scene where a killer calls a victim. Watch it here:
I wanted to re-create this scene using Twilio, so I built it with Twilio Studio, a low-code tool from Twilio.
If you want to try it out, text anything to (940) 394-8137
I also wrote a tutorial, so you can build this app yourself.</description>

      <description>TLDR: This is a tutorial on how to build a Halloween project that you can use to scare friends and family.

Here it is in action:
Tutorial Technologies used in this project are Twilio Studio. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple to create because it&amp;rsquo;s a low-code tool that uses drag n drop.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been a company sponsor at a tech conference, you&amp;rsquo;d know that attracting attendees is difficult. This project solves that issue, because attendees can interact with a video game while also learning about Twilio products &amp;amp; offerings.
TwilioQuest is Twilio&amp;rsquo;s educational video game. Within the game, you can add your own custom extensions to it. I forked a version of Nathaniel&amp;rsquo;s, another Twilio Developer Evangelist, and added multiple features/improvements to it.</description>
