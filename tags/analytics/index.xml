      <description>After working on this website for weeks, on December 20th, I shared the finished product on social media platforms (like LinkedIn). I expected people to view the site, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure about the number of users, how engaged they&amp;rsquo;d be, etc. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve Google Analytics built-in, I was curious to get insights from the tool and gather information from that data.

      <description>Google Analytics is a web analytics tool that lets you track &amp;amp; report your website&amp;rsquo;s traffic. It shows you information such as how many users have visited your site, what devices they use (mobile or computer), how they found your site (direct url, link from other sites), etc.
Google Analytics, or similar type of analytics tool, is a must have for any front-end developer, as it helps them track user engagement.</description>
