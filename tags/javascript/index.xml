After writing multiple blog posts, I quickly realized that more pages meant more clutter. If someone wants to find a post, they&amp;rsquo;d have to manually search for it by digging through each page. Imagine if I have 10 pages, with 6 blog posts per page.</description>

      <description>LinkedIn to JSON Resume is a Chrome Extension that fetches data from your LinkedIn profile and exports the data into JSON. This JSON can then be used with the JSON Resume Schema. I use LinkedIn a lot and thought that this tool would be a great way to have a &amp;lsquo;single source of truth&amp;rsquo;.
