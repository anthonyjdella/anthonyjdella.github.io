      <description>I wanted to be alerted of new job postings, so I created this script. The source code can be found on GitHub and an article/blog post with instructions on how to build it is found here.
In summary, it uses Puppeteer, an Automation library that automatically controls Chrome, to visit job seeking websites. Then, it scrapes that data, formats it, and sends those job postings to me via email.</description>
