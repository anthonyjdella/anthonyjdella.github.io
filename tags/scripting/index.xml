      <description>TLDR: I explain how you can write an automated script that looks at job postings from companies and emails you the results.
Have you ever been disappointed to know that you got rejected from a job because you applied too late? They already hired someone else!
How many times have you missed out on job opportunities because you didnâ€™t know a company was hiring for that position? It might be the perfect job for you, but you just didnâ€™t know about it!</description>

      <description>I wanted to be alerted of new job postings, so I created this script. The source code can be found on GitHub and an article/blog post with instructions on how to build it is found here.
In summary, it uses Puppeteer, an Automation library that automatically controls Chrome, to visit job seeking websites. Then, it scrapes that data, formats it, and sends those job postings to me via email.</description>
