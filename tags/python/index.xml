      <description>TLDR: This is a tutorial on how to build a Python app that will summarize text that you take from images.
Overview Content, content, content! There&amp;rsquo;s too much content out there and too much to read. Don&amp;rsquo;t you wish you could pull out your phone -&amp;gt; take a picture of a book -&amp;gt; get texted a summary of what it says?
I built a Python app that does just this, and I&amp;rsquo;ll teach you how you can build it too.</description>

      <description>TLDR: I participated in a MongoDB Hackathon and share what I learned about MongoDB and Django.
Hackathon On Dev Community, I saw a post for a Hackathon sponsored by MongoDB and thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a shot. I have no experience with MongoDB so I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun. Unfortunately, I saw the post only a few days before the due date, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to finish it.</description>
