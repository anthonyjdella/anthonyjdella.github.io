      <description>If you go to the home page of this website, you might find some hidden &amp;ldquo;easter eggs&amp;rdquo; around the page. One of which is an emoji that is animated using CSS. ðŸ‘‹ is the emoji. It&amp;rsquo;s just a waving hand, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually wave. There is no animation, so I wanted to make it move. It&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty easy!
Step 1: Create HTML &amp;lt;div class=&amp;#34;waving&amp;#34; data-hover=&amp;#34;ðŸ‘‹&amp;#34;&amp;gt; Hi &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; All I&amp;rsquo;ve done here is create a simple div with the text, &amp;ldquo;Hi&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Having an online personal brand is ever so important. Part of this includes having a unified profile picture and logo. You can take this to another level by animating the logo!
Although I have experience with design tools like Photoshop, Lightroom, and Premiere I have never worked with animation. I found a website called SVGator which animates SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). The free version has many limitations but I was able to use it to create my animated logo.</description>
