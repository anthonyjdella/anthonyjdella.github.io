      <title>Updating My Avatar</title>

      <description>TLDR: Refreshed my outdated avatar, which I use for social media.
  New Avatar Since I use an illustrative self-portrait for my social media handles, it&amp;rsquo;s sometimes hard for people to tell what I really look like IRL. Originally, I made my avatar back in 2018 or 2019. But since then, I have a different hairstyle. It&amp;rsquo;s important to make your profile picture (regardless of medium) look like you as much as possible.</description>

      <guid>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/mongodb-atlas-hackathon/</guid>
      <description>TLDR: I participated in a MongoDB Hackathon and share what I learned about MongoDB and Django.
  Hackathon On Dev Community, I saw a post for a Hackathon sponsored by MongoDB and thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a shot. I have no experience with MongoDB so I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be fun. Unfortunately, I saw the post only a few days before the due date, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to finish it.</description>

      <title>Rogue Dev Purposely Breaks Software ðŸš«</title>

      <guid>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/rogue-dev-purposely-breaks-software/</guid>
      <description>TLDR: A software developer who made some highly used open source software, decided to go rogue and inject a bug into his software, making it crash. This affected every other dependency (and developer) using his software.
  Bug Breaks my Software Deployment Over the weekend, I was deploying some software (to Firebase) with CI/CD pipelines. But for some reason, the pipelines were failing. The failure occurred at this stage of my GitHub Actions workflow:</description>

      <title>How to Add Search to Your Hugo Static Site ðŸ”Ž</title>
      <link>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/how-to-add-search-to-your-hugo-static-site/</link>

      <guid>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/how-to-add-search-to-your-hugo-static-site/</guid>
      <description>TLDR: Use Algolia to create fast searching of your website&amp;rsquo;s static pages. This tutorial is for sites using Hugo.
 If you view my Blog section, you&amp;rsquo;ll see a search bar that I&amp;rsquo;ve just added.
After writing multiple blog posts, I quickly realized that more pages meant more clutter. If someone wants to find a post, they&amp;rsquo;d have to manually search for it by digging through each page. Imagine if I have 10 pages, with 6 blog posts per page.</description>

      <title>Is 99% Good? ðŸ“ˆ</title>
      <link>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/is-99-good/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 12:49:27 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/is-99-good/</guid>
      <description>TLDR: 99% availability for a software system isn&amp;rsquo;t a good measurement. Instead of using a percentage, use a probability or actual time values.
 If you ever took a test at school, you&amp;rsquo;d probably be really happy with getting a 99 grade. After all, it&amp;rsquo;s almost a perfect score.
But when you&amp;rsquo;re talking about software systems, is 99% availability good?
Well, if your system needs to be available 24/7 everyday, 99% won&amp;rsquo;t cut it.</description>

      <title>How to Forward Emails to Your Domain ðŸ“§</title>
      <link>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/how-to-forward-emails-to-your-domain/</link>

      <guid>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/how-to-forward-emails-to-your-domain/</guid>
      <description>TLDR: Set up Gmail forwarding so it looks like your email address matches your domain name.
 Want to organize your email inbox?
How about exposing a different email address for different purposes?
I set up email forwarding so that I can receive emails to my existing Gmail inboxes, but use different email address names.
For example, these are my different email addresses:
 hello@anthonydellavecchia.com - general things dev@anthonydellavecchia.com - software development hireme@anthonydellavecchia.</description>

      <description>TLDR: Just some analytics about my website users after I shared it on LinkedIn and other social media sites.
 After working on this website for weeks, on December 20th, I shared the finished product on social media platforms (like LinkedIn). I expected people to view the site, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure about the number of users, how engaged they&amp;rsquo;d be, etc. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve Google Analytics built-in, I was curious to get insights from the tool and gather information from that data.</description>

      <title>How to Check your Website Users (Minus Yourself) ðŸ‘¥</title>
      <link>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/how-to-check-your-website-users/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 12:49:27 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/how-to-check-your-website-users/</guid>
      <description>TLDR: I explain how you can filter out yourself from Google Analytics so you can see real user data.
 Google Analytics is a web analytics tool that lets you track &amp;amp; report your website&amp;rsquo;s traffic. It shows you information such as how many users have visited your site, what devices they use (mobile or computer), how they found your site (direct url, link from other sites), etc.
Google Analytics, or similar type of analytics tool, is a must have for any front-end developer, as it helps them track user engagement.</description>

      <title>How to Animate an Emoji with CSS ðŸ‘‹</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 12:49:27 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/how-to-animate-an-emoji-with-css/</guid>
      <description>TLDR: You can animate an Emoji (or anything else) by using keyframes in CSS.
 If you go to the home page of this website, you might find some hidden &amp;ldquo;easter eggs&amp;rdquo; around the page. One of which is an emoji that is animated using CSS. ðŸ‘‹ is the emoji. It&amp;rsquo;s just a waving hand, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually wave. There is no animation, so I wanted to make it move.</description>

      <title>JSON Resume Themes</title>
      <link>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/portfolio/json-resume-themes/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 12:49:27 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/portfolio/json-resume-themes/</guid>
      <description>I customized and tweaked multiple existing themes for my resume, which can be viewed in conjunction with my JSON Resume. I didn&amp;rsquo;t build these from scratch, only customized them to my liking. Currently I have customized 14 themes, all of which can be viewed from the homepage of this site.
Users can easily view my Resume by selecting a different one from a dropdown menu.
Each theme is unique and has a different style for different audiences.</description>

      <title>Designing an Animated Logo ðŸŽ¨</title>
      <link>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/designing-an-animated-logo/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 12:49:27 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/designing-an-animated-logo/</guid>
      <description>TLDR: I make an animated logo (think of a .GIF) and explain how you can make one too.
 Having an online personal brand is ever so important. Part of this includes having a unified profile picture and logo. You can take this to another level by animating the logo!
Although I have experience with design tools like Photoshop, Lightroom, and Premiere I have never worked with animation. I found a website called SVGator which animates SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics).</description>

      <description>JSON Resume is an open source project to standardize JSON-based resumes. JSON is a widely used file format that most developers are familiar with, so this is a great tool for developers. With this initiative, put your resume into a JSON file and it can be used with various front-ends. One resume with multiple themes!
http://registry.jsonresume.org is the webpage used for that project. If you append your GitHub username to that URL (e.</description>

      <title>LinkedIn to JSON Chrome Extension</title>
      <link>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/portfolio/linkedin-to-json-chrome-extension/</link>

      <guid>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/portfolio/linkedin-to-json-chrome-extension/</guid>
      <description>LinkedIn to JSON Resume is a Chrome Extension that fetches data from your LinkedIn profile and exports the data into JSON. This JSON can then be used with the JSON Resume Schema. I use LinkedIn a lot and thought that this tool would be a great way to have a &amp;lsquo;single source of truth&amp;rsquo;. So with this, if I keep my LinkedIn up to date, I won&amp;rsquo;t need to manage a resume or JSON file.</description>

      <guid>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/building-this-site/</guid>
      <description>TLDR: These are the commands I use to build this website.
 This is for my reference, so I remember how to make changes to this site without any hiccups.
 cd into personal-website directory Make changes.  hugo serve to start local server. Commit and push changes to personal-website repository (source files). If changes are done to the Portio theme, cd into themes/portio .  Commit and push changes to portio-theme repository (theme files).</description>

      <title>This Website</title>

      <guid>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/portfolio/this-site/</guid>
      <description>Initially, the goal of this site was to quickly create and deploy a personal website. However, over time, I became more and more invested in it. I&amp;rsquo;ve spend HOURS customizing and adding in new features. Check out this Kanban board which shows how many enhancements I&amp;rsquo;ve made.
Since my main goal was to quickly create a website, I used Hugo, a popular open-source static site generator. Hugo is built with Go lang.</description>

      <title>Magic Numbers ðŸª„</title>
      <link>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/magic-numbers/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2018 12:49:27 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/magic-numbers/</guid>
      <description>TLDR: A software development principle to follow with an example.
 Today, I got feedback from a code review and learned something new. It was about &amp;ldquo;magic numbers&amp;rdquo;, which are unique values with unexplained meaning or multiple occurrences which could (preferably) be replaced with named constants.
I&amp;rsquo;ve known about the concept of using constants rather than hard-coding values, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t think of that for &amp;ldquo;magic number&amp;rdquo; situations. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty simple concept but I just wanted to share what I learned.</description>

      <title>How to Never Miss Out on a Job Opening ðŸ¤–</title>
      <link>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/how-to-never-miss-out-on-a-job-opening/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Mar 2018 12:49:27 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/how-to-never-miss-out-on-a-job-opening/</guid>
      <description>TLDR: I explain how you can write an automated script that looks at job postings from companies and emails you the results.
 Have you ever been disappointed to know that you got rejected from a job because you applied too late? They already hired someone else!
How many times have you missed out on job opportunities because you didnâ€™t know a company was hiring for that position? It might be the perfect job for you, but you just didnâ€™t know about it!</description>

      <title>Automated Job Search</title>

      <guid>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/portfolio/automated-job-search/</guid>
      <description>I wanted to be alerted of new job postings, so I created this script. The source code can be found on GitHub and an article/blog post with instructions on how to build it is found here.
In summary, it uses Puppeteer, an Automation library that automatically controls Chrome, to visit job seeking websites. Then, it scrapes that data, formats it, and sends those job postings to me via email.</description>

      <description>TLDR: Just some markdown and what it looks like on this site.
 This is a collection of markdown examples, which also work with Hugo. (For my reference when adding markdown to future blog posts.)
