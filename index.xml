      <title>How to Add Search to Your Hugo Static Site</title>

      <description>After writing multiple blog posts, I quickly realized that more pages meant more clutter. If someone wants to find a post, they&amp;rsquo;d have to manually search for it by digging through each page. Imagine if I have 10 pages, with 6 blog posts per page. Finding an article would be difficult and a bad user experience. Adding a search bar, as well as tag filters, would fix this issue, so I did some research on how to implement this for my website.</description>

      <description>If you ever took a test at school, you&amp;rsquo;d probably be really happy with getting a 99 grade. After all, it&amp;rsquo;s almost a perfect score.
But when you&amp;rsquo;re talking about software systems, is 99% availability good?
Well, if your system needs to be available 24/7 everyday, 99% won&amp;rsquo;t cut it.
Downtime Table Take a look at the below table. It shows how much downtime (in time) equals a given percentage.</description>

      <description>Want to organize your email inbox?
How about exposing a different email address for different purposes?
I set up email forwarding so that I can receive emails to my existing Gmail inboxes, but use different email address names.
For example, these are my different email addresses:
 hello@anthonydellavecchia.com - general things dev@anthonydellavecchia.com - software development hireme@anthonydellavecchia.com - job seeking photo@anthonydellavecchia.com - photography design@anthonydellavecchia.com - design  What&amp;rsquo;s the Point? Everything is</description>

      <description>After working on this website for weeks, on December 20th, I shared the finished product on social media platforms (like LinkedIn). I expected people to view the site, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure about the number of users, how engaged they&amp;rsquo;d be, etc. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve Google Analytics built-in, I was curious to get insights from the tool and gather information from that data. Sure, I could do this analysis by myself, but why would I?</description>

      <description>Google Analytics is a web analytics tool that lets you track &amp;amp; report your website&amp;rsquo;s traffic. It shows you information such as how many users have visited your site, what devices they use (mobile or computer), how they found your site (direct url, link from other sites), etc.
Google Analytics, or similar type of analytics tool, is a must have for any front-end developer, as it helps them track user engagement.</description>

      <title>How to Animate an Emoji with CSS</title>

      <guid>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/blog/how-to-animate-an-emoji-with-css/</guid>
      <description>If you go to the home page of this website, you might find some hidden &amp;ldquo;easter eggs&amp;rdquo; around the page. One of which is an emoji that is animated using CSS. ðŸ‘‹ is the emoji. It&amp;rsquo;s just a waving hand, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually wave. There is no animation, so I wanted to make it move. It&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty easy!
Step 1: Create HTML &amp;lt;div class=&amp;#34;waving&amp;#34; data-hover=&amp;#34;ðŸ‘‹&amp;#34;&amp;gt; Hi &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; All I&amp;rsquo;ve done here is create a simple div with the text, &amp;ldquo;Hi&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>JSON Resume Themes</title>

      <description>I customized and tweaked multiple existing themes for my resume, which can be viewed in conjunction with my JSON Resume. I didn&amp;rsquo;t build these from scratch, only customized them to my liking. Currently I have customized 14 themes, all of which can be viewed from the homepage of this site.
Users can easily view my Resume by selecting a different one from a dropdown menu.
Each theme is unique and has a different style for different audiences.</description>

      <title>Designing an Animated Logo</title>

      <description>Having an online personal brand is ever so important. Part of this includes having a unified profile picture and logo. You can take this to another level by animating the logo!
Although I have experience with design tools like Photoshop, Lightroom, and Premiere I have never worked with animation. I found a website called SVGator which animates SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). The free version has many limitations but I was able to use it to create my animated logo.</description>

      <description>JSON Resume is an open source project to standardize JSON-based resumes. JSON is a widely used file format that most developers are familiar with, so this is a great tool for developers. With this initiative, put your resume into a JSON file and it can be used with various front-ends. One resume with multiple themes!
http://registry.jsonresume.org is the webpage used for that project. If you append your GitHub username to that URL (e.</description>

      <title>LinkedIn to JSON Chrome Extension</title>

      <description>LinkedIn to JSON Resume is a Chrome Extension that fetches data from your LinkedIn profile and exports the data into JSON. This JSON can then be used with the JSON Resume Schema. I use LinkedIn a lot and thought that this tool would be a great way to have a &amp;lsquo;single source of truth&amp;rsquo;. So with this, if I keep my LinkedIn up to date, I won&amp;rsquo;t need to manage a resume or JSON file.</description>

      <description>This is for my reference, so I remember how to make changes to this site without any hiccups.
 cd into personal-website directory Make changes.  hugo serve to start local server. Commit and push changes to personal-website repository (source files). If changes are done to the Portio theme, cd into themes/portio .  Commit and push changes to portio-theme repository (theme files).    hugo -t portio to build static files which will go in the /public  directory.</description>

      <description>Initially, the goal of this site was to quickly create and deploy a personal website. However, over time, I became more and more invested in it. I&amp;rsquo;ve spend HOURS customizing and adding in new features. Check out this Kanban board which shows how many enhancements I&amp;rsquo;ve made.
Since my main goal was to quickly create a website, I used Hugo, a popular open-source static site generator. Hugo is built with Go lang.</description>

      <title>Magic Numbers</title>

      <description>Today, I got feedback from a code review and learned something new. It was about &amp;ldquo;magic numbers&amp;rdquo;, which are unique values with unexplained meaning or multiple occurrences which could (preferably) be replaced with named constants.
I&amp;rsquo;ve known about the concept of using constants rather than hard-coding values, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t think of that for &amp;ldquo;magic number&amp;rdquo; situations. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty simple concept but I just wanted to share what I learned.</description>

      <description>I wanted to be alerted of new job postings, so I created this script. The source code can be found on GitHub and an article/blog post with instructions on how to build it is found here.
In summary, it uses Puppeteer, an Automation library that automatically controls Chrome, to visit job seeking websites. Then, it scrapes that data, formats it, and sends those job postings to me via email.</description>
