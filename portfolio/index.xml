      <description>What is a Decentralized Identity? When you log into Facebook, you have to create an account and identity with them. When you log into Instagram, you have to do the same thing. When you log into TikTok, you do it again. For every website you use, you create an identity and that is stored and controlled by that corporation. What if you could create 1 identity and share it across all platforms?</description>

      <description>Daily Stand-Up is a meeting that many developers have to do on a daily basis. And it SUCKS!
The reasons why we (developers) hate it:
It&amp;rsquo;s just another meeting You have to stand up You have to listen to that one rambling co-worker (aka Chad) I built this app that solves these problems
It was built with:
Studio, a low-code tool from Twilio Airtable, a database/spreadsheet REST APIs that I built in Python and Flask If you want to try it out, text anything to (844) 668-2535</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Halloween! Want to scare your friends and family with a fun app?
If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with Scream, a famous movie from 1996, there&amp;rsquo;s a famous scene where a killer calls a victim. Watch it here:
I wanted to re-create this scene using Twilio, so I built it with Twilio Studio, a low-code tool from Twilio.
If you want to try it out, text anything to (940) 394-8137
I also wrote a tutorial, so you can build this app yourself.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been a company sponsor at a tech conference, you&amp;rsquo;d know that attracting attendees is difficult. This project solves that issue, because attendees can interact with a video game while also learning about Twilio products &amp;amp; offerings.
TwilioQuest is Twilio&amp;rsquo;s educational video game. Within the game, you can add your own custom extensions to it. I forked a version of Nathaniel&amp;rsquo;s, another Twilio Developer Evangelist, and added multiple features/improvements to it.</description>

      <title>Silent Network Authentication (SNA) at Signal 2022</title>
      <link>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/portfolio/sna/</link>

      <description>OTP (One-Time Password) methods validate user authentication but the user experience is compromised. Users are sent a password which they then must enter to verify their identity. With SNA, the verification happens in the background for a seamless user experience.
For Twilio Signal 2022, I created a demo iOS application that showcases SNA. It was featured during the keynote here:

Pull out your phone -&amp;gt; Take a picture of it -&amp;gt; Get texted a summary of what it says
Here it is in action:
I also wrote a tutorial, so you can build this app yourself. Check it out on Twilio&amp;rsquo;s Blog.

      <description>F5 Season is an NBA meme that means fans are constantly refreshing their news feeds to learn about breaking news.
&amp;gt; F5 on your keyboard is the refresh button. I built an app that sends you NBA news whenever you text &amp;ldquo;F5&amp;rdquo; to your Twilio phone number. Why? Well, during the NBA offseason, fans want to have up-to-date info about recent trades or trade requests.
I also wrote a tutorial, so you can build this app yourself.</description>

      <title>JSON Resume Themes</title>

      <guid>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/portfolio/json-resume-themes/</guid>
      <description>I customized and tweaked multiple existing themes for my resume, which can be viewed in conjunction with my JSON Resume. I didn&amp;rsquo;t build these from scratch, only customized them to my liking. Currently I have customized 14 themes, all of which can be viewed from the homepage of this site.
Users can easily view my Resume by selecting a different one from a dropdown menu.
Each theme is unique and has a different style for different audiences.</description>

      <description>JSON Resume is an open source project to standardize JSON-based resumes. JSON is a widely used file format that most developers are familiar with, so this is a great tool for developers. With this initiative, put your resume into a JSON file and it can be used with various front-ends. One resume with multiple themes!
http://registry.jsonresume.org is the webpage used for that project. If you append your GitHub username to that URL (e.</description>

      <title>LinkedIn to JSON Chrome Extension</title>

      <guid>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/portfolio/linkedin-to-json-chrome-extension/</guid>
      <description>LinkedIn to JSON Resume is a Chrome Extension that fetches data from your LinkedIn profile and exports the data into JSON. This JSON can then be used with the JSON Resume Schema. I use LinkedIn a lot and thought that this tool would be a great way to have a &amp;lsquo;single source of truth&amp;rsquo;. So with this, if I keep my LinkedIn up to date, I won&amp;rsquo;t need to manage a resume or JSON file.</description>

      <description>Initially, the goal of this site was to quickly create and deploy a personal website. However, over time, I became more and more invested in it. I&amp;rsquo;ve spend HOURS customizing and adding in new features. Check out this Kanban board which shows how many enhancements I&amp;rsquo;ve made.
Since my main goal was to quickly create a website, I used Hugo, a popular open-source static site generator. Hugo is built with Go lang.</description>

      <guid>https://anthonydellavecchia.com/portfolio/automated-job-search/</guid>
      <description>I wanted to be alerted of new job postings, so I created this script. The source code can be found on GitHub and an article/blog post with instructions on how to build it is found here.
In summary, it uses Puppeteer, an Automation library that automatically controls Chrome, to visit job seeking websites. Then, it scrapes that data, formats it, and sends those job postings to me via email.</description>
